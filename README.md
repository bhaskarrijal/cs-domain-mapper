# CS DOMAIN MAPPER

## Description
This is a python script that maps the domains of Computer Science. It is a simple script that uses the `networkx` library to create a graph of the domains and subdomains of Computer Science. The script reads a JSON file that contains the domains and subdomains and creates a graph of the domains and subdomains. The script then saves the graph as a `png` image.
